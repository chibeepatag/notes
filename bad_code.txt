what is wrong with this?
code is dependent on primary keys of document types not to change! It assumes every database
this will run on, document types will have the same ids
Also, it is not readable. 

 -------------------
found in document.rb
frequent use of ids as static fields
self.document_type_id == 4

What is wrong with this? The next developer reading this code (e.g. ME! I was a victim of this) will have
to keep looking up what is document_type with id 4? Pull up database and queries. Slows down development time!

Fix:
self.document_type.code == 'release_supplier'
Isn't this a lot easier to understand?

	def customer
		Customer.find(self.customer_id).name if !self.customer_id.nil?
	end

	def customer_object
		Customer.find(self.customer_id) if !self.customer_id.nil?
	end

	Developer made this work around to avoid rails requirement of belongs_to as a required field.
	Whats wrong with this? Customer has no relation to invoice! 

	Fix:
	belongs_to :customer, optional: true
